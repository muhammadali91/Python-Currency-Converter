 the how Code for making Python Currency Converter
 
 
 Exchange rates change every day, so your program would quickly become either obsolete or unmaintainable by having the conversion factor as a constant in the program.

You have a supported currencies dictionary, but you don't test if the user input is among the supported ones. This can be done with a while True: loop and then break if the user choice is ok.

I also believe that the user would be bummed for having to digit the currency abbreviation :p...

Taking those considerations in mind and i already uplaod a code
